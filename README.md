## NOTE

DO NOTE THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS UNFINISHED AS OF YET EFI SOLUTION TO BOOT MACOS ON THIS HARDWARE.

Everything (for the most part) is working minus physical trackpad left / right buttons (tap to click works though, as Trackpad Prefs are present in System Preferences, and you can also turn on dragging via Trackpad Options in Accessbility), Sleep/Wake (as I've applied the proper AML patching and ran SSDTTime as well, but can't seem to get it not to instant wake still?), and VGA output (which never had support in macOS).
