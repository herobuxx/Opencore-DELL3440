# Dell-Latitude-3440-4th-Gen-Core-i3-4010U-1.7GHz
OpenCore EFI for Dell Latitude 3440 4th Gen Core i3-4010U 1.7GHz (Tested on Mojave/Catalina)

Everything is working minus physical trackpad left / right buttons (tapping works though, as Trackpad Prefs are present in System Preferences), and VGA output.
